## Cedric's Community words

# Project OverView

### I chose the words by Jadakiss in the song “one more mile to go” because they bring to light the reality that community can be built through shared circumstances. Sometimes as a community all you can do is keep pushing to the next step. Many times, my community members and I have been faced with not only physical adversity but mental health issues as well. There has been a constant and systematic attempt to degrade and dismiss the most vulnerable parts of my community. It seems as though no matter what, we are forced to try and keep our head above water in hope of finding a safe place to rest. There have been very few safe places. Each page is set to reflect how the word make me feel about community. The typography was chosen not only to represent the words on the page but also how they repreesent my connection to the many communities I am a part of. The colors were a balancing act between contrast and emotional value. Each page represents how a communinty may feel collectively and how one may feel isolated within their communities.  Lyrics by Jadakiss From the song 'One more mile to go'
