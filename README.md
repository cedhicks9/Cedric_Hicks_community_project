## Cedric's Community words

# Project OverView

### I chose the words by Jadakiss in the song “one more mile to go” because they bring to light the reality that community can be built through shared circumstances. Sometimes as a community all you can do is keep pushing to the next step. Many times, my community members and I have been faced with not only physical adversity but mental health issues as well. There has been a constant and systematic attempt to degrade and dismiss the most vulnerable parts of my community. It seems as though no matter what, we are forced to try and keep our head above water in hope of finding a safe place to rest. There have been very few safe places.
