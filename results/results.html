    <p>"When it all seems hopeless, real hard to focus
        Simple dilemmas become hard for you to cope with
        Taking things personal, easily insulted
        Doing dumb shit, and don't care what the results is
        Ain't scared to die, but you thinking 'bout a coffin
        And quitting ain't an option but you think about it often
        Saying to yourself, how this ain't fair
        You got the strength but the energy, just ain't there
        That same vision that you used to have just ain't clear"</p>
